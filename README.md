# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a full stack web application that simulates another well known application (which I won't name).

It is primarily a client-side Single Page App (SPA).

The client-side app communicates with a server via AJAX and tweets are persisted to a MongoDB which allows to survive a server restart or shutdown.
